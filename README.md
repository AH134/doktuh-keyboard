# Doktuh Keyboard

> WIP as I have not yet received the PCBs and parts to assemble the keyboard.

It's just a [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) (Sweep High) with [Arknights](https://www.arknights.global/) design.

## Notes

I have removed the sweep high switch plate in favor of a custom designed base plate that allows for better eye candy with the silkscreen designs.
